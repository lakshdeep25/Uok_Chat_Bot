Measures for Prohibition of Ragging At University Level:

The University shall strictly observe the provisions of the Act of the Central Government and the State Governments, if any, or if enacted, considering raging as a cognizable offence under the law on a par with rape and other atrocities against women and ill-treatment of persons belonging to the SC/ST, and prohibiting ragging in all its forms in all institutions.

Ragging in all its forms shall be totally banned in the entire University Campus, including its departments, constituent units, all its premises (academic, residential, sports, canteen, etc.) whether located within the campus or outside residential, sports, canteen, etc.) whether located within the campus or outside and in all means of transportation of students whether public or private.

The University shall take strict action against those found guilty of ragging and/or of abetting ragging.
The application form for admission/enrolment has a printed undertaking in English to be filled up and signed by the candidate to the effect that he/she is aware of the law regarding prohibition of ragging as well as the punishments, and to the effect that he/she has not been expelled and /or debarred from admission by any institution and that he/she, if found guilty of the offence of ragging and/or abetting ragging, is liable to be punished appropriately.

The application form also contains a printed undertaking, in English to be signed by the parents/guardian of the applicant to the effect that he/she is also aware of the law in this regard and agrees to abide by the punishment meted out to his/her ward in case the latter is found guilty of ragging and/or abetting ragging.

The application for admission shall be accompanied by a document in the form of the School Leaving Certificate/Transfer Certificate/Migration Certificate/Character Certificate which shall include a report on the behavioral pattern of the applicant, so that the University can thereafter keep intense watch upon a student who has a negative entry in this regard. At the commencement of the academic session the Head of the Institution shall convene and address a meeting of various functionaries/agencies, like Hostel Wardens, representatives of students, parents/guardians, faculty, district administration including police, to discuss the measures to be taken to prevent ragging in the University and steps to be taken to identify the offenders and punish them suitably.

To make the community at large and the students in particular aware of the dehumanizing effect of ragging, and the approach of the institution towards those indulging in ragging, big posters (preferably multi-colored with different colours for the provisions of law, punishments, etc.) shall be prominently displayed on all Notice Boards of all Departments, hostels and other buildings as well as at vulnerable places. Some of such posters shall be of permanent nature in certain vulnerable places.

Measures for encouraging healthy interaction between fresher and seniors

The institution shall set up appropriate committees including the course in charge, student advisor, Warden and some senior students to actively monitor, promote and regulate healthy interaction between the freshers and senior students.

Freshers' welcome parties shall be organized in each department by the senior students and the faculty together soon after admissions, preferably within the first two weeks of the beginning of the academic session, for proper introduction to one another and where the talents of the freshers are brought out properly in the presence of the faculty, thus helping them to shed their inferiority complex, if any, and remove their inhibitions. Depending upon the nature and gravity of the offence as established by the Anti-Ragging Committee of the University, the possible punishments for those found guilty of ragging at the University level shall be any one of any combination of the following.
